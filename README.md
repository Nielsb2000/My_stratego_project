# My_stratego_project


In here; a documentation and representation of how to replicate the work will be stored, commited files are downloaded from google collab and stored here for public access.



For downloading the data please refer to Strados2 on the Gravon platform, there you can manually download all the files. Remove the files that are not named "Classic", this includes "FreeClassic". After this running the content extraction file will produce a new file that you can use to run in the neural net notebook for training the graph neural network. If you haven't removed all files the content extraction should also ignore these files and remove them. Please add the files into a folder called files and run the content extraction code first, this will create 2 new files. Upload these files to google drive and add them to a folder called files in the same folder as where you will execute the google collab notebooks. Then having the directory look like mydrive -> yourproject(where you story the notebooks) -> files(where you store the data), having done this all should work accordingly.
